/* 
Object Literals and the Brackets Notation
By the end of this reading, you'll be able to:

Explain how to build objects using the brackets notation

Explain that with the brackets notation you can use the space character inside keys, since property keys are strings

Explain that the keys inside the brackets notation are evaluated

Object literals and the brackets notation
There is an alternative syntax to the dot notation I used up until this point.

This alternative syntax is known as the brackets notation.

To understand how it works, it's best to use an example, so I'll go through the process of coding the house2 object again, in the same way that I did with the dot notation, only this time, I'll use the brackets notation.
