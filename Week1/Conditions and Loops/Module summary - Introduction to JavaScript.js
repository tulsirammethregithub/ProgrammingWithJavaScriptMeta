You've reached the final video in this lesson on conditionals and loops and the end of the introduction to JavaScript module. Let's take a few moments to recap on what you've learned. In this module, you have learned how to explain what programming is and the role it plays in the modern world, describe what JavaScript is and its value as a web development tool, describe how developers interact with the JavaScript engine to create web experiences, create variables and assign or reassign the values they contain, identify the seven primitive data types in JavaScript and how they differ from one another. Explain what strings are and the syntax for building them, identify the values of the Boolean data type, and explain what you can and cannot do with the numbers datatype. Build if else statements to create conditional outcomes and build for loops to repeat repetitive tasks. Congratulations, you have now completed this module. Great work.
