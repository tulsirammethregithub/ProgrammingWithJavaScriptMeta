Correct
That's correct! The code inside the if statement will execute because the condition  i < 5  is true.

Hello


Goodbye

Correct
That's correct! The condition checks if  i  is equal to  0  AND  1 . Since it is not possible for  i  to be both values at the same time, the result of this check is false. Therefore, the code inside the else statement will run. */

Correct
That's correct! The inner loop will be run twice by the outer loop. Since the inner loop runs 3 times, the  console.log  will be called 6 times in total.

Correct
That's correct! The code inside the else if statement will execute. The first condition fails because the value of  i  is greater than 5. The second condition succeeds because the value of  i  is less than 10.
